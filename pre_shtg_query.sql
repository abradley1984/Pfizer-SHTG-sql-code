/* 
 This code outputs:
   1. the distribution of lab results with the lab result unit.
     I want to make sure Iâ€™m accounting for all units that come up at each site (e.g. mg/dL vs g/dL)

   2. The distribution of primary payer type categories (insurance) so I can make sure I'm aggregating appropriately.
   I realize not all sites populate this info, so let me know if that's the case for your site.

where it says "Pitt" for site_name (both queries) below, please replace with an identifier for your site.
This version runs in oracle.
 I've included what I think are the edits needed for a sql server version as comments, although I haven't checked so please let the group know if more edits are needed.
